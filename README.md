# HomeAutomationPrototype
This repository is a series of tutorials that will help you build your own Smart Home automation system. 

Tutorial 1: Learn to connect sensors to an arduino and collect data with them.

Most sensors have a pin for Ground (marked as G or GND), a pin for VCC and another for the data. They can be connected as following (DHT11 used as example):

We will use Arduino IDE to make the code for the arduino/ESP and read the data collected from the sensors. The IDE looks like following:
