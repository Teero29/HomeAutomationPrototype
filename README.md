# Tutorial 4: Sending and recieving signals with bluetooth between Arduino and Raspberry Pi
In the first tutorial we saw how to manage sensors and the data captured by them. Now we will learn to send this data. First, we will look at the Arduino side and then the Raspberry Pi.

# 1. Connecting the module to Arduino

# 2. Setting up the code
The code provided in BT_v2.ino lets us write(send) and read(receive) data through bluetooth on an arduino.

# 3. Using bluetooth on a Raspberry Pi (in Python)
